Write the code and throw it into the water.

### ðŸªš Job offers

- âš¡ ***I do not participate in any blockchain chats and do not write to anyone with any propositions there. You are probably being scammed***
- I'm not much interested in part time or freelance offers
- âš¡ I have no accounts on any freelance job sites
- âš¡ If someone refers this Github as their portfolio, check if they can give a proof (e.g. with my GPG key **BDF3D58D2CC4055F**)

### ðŸ”Œ What i do
- I develop internal cloud solutions for [Yandex](https://yandex.com)
- I can write in C, Python and Rust
- If the task is interesting, I can try to remember OCaml
- If the task is important, I can write C++, Go and almost anything
- âš¡ Just don't ask me to do anything with word "Java" in its name
- âš¡ Javascript included

### ðŸ“Ÿ The code
- Most of my code is available here
- Some old code also can be found on [Launchpad](https://code.launchpad.net/~torkvemada)
- I prefer Mercurial even for Git, so most my repositories contain `.hgignore`
- I use my own [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/torkve/torkve-code-of-conduct) and recommend it for everyone

### ðŸ’¬ Contacts

- For anything with my projects just create an issue in relevant repository
- For something not related to Github, feel free to contact me over [Telegram](https://t.me/the_ook)
- âš¡ I have no other Telegram accounts
- âš¡ Email addresses, that are not included into my GPG key **BDF3D58D2CC4055F**, probably ain't mine
- âš¡ Using any other messengers require the GPG signed proof of ownership
- I speak Russian, Polish and English
- I can also understand some Spanish and Serbian, but no guarantees included
